#Google Drive Attachement Module for Odoo

This module allows the attachment of Google Drive document to all records and
also to directly upload new document to a dedicated folder on gdrive.

This will considerably reduce the size required for your attachement.

#Configuration

You must create a Google API ClientID using your Google account :
- Go to the Google Cloud Console
- Ceate a new project
- Go to APIs & Auth/Credentials
- Enable Drive and Picker API
- Add a credentials of type OAuth 2.0 client ID
- Select Web application 
- Fill in both Authorized Redirect URIs and Authorized JavaScript Origins to your Odoo hostname.
- Copy paste the client_id in the Configuration/Knowledge section. 

If you are also using the Google Authentication module you can use the same id, just 
copy/paste it.

The folder where the files will be uploaded must be set in the 
Configuration/Knowledge section. Just browse your GDrive to the directory and
the id is in the url "https://...../folders/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX just copy everything
after /folders/ to the "Google Drive Upload Directory" parameter.

#What's next

An interesting behaviour would be to also replace the storage of reports
(invoices) generated by the reporting module.
